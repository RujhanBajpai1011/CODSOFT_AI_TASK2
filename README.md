# 🖼️ Image Captioning

This project demonstrates a basic **image captioning** system using a pre-trained **ResNet50** model for extracting image features.

## **✨ Features**

* **Feature Extraction**: Uses ResNet50 to get important information from images.
* **Dummy Caption**: Currently provides a simple placeholder caption like "Generated Caption (dummy text)".
* **Easy to Use**: Set up to be straightforward for testing image input.

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**

* **Python**
* **PyTorch** (`torch`, `torchvision`): For the deep learning model.
* **Pillow** (`PIL`): For handling image files.

## **📦 Requirements**

You'll need these Python libraries:

* `torch`
* `torchvision`
* `Pillow`

## **🚀 Getting Started**

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository (if applicable):**

```
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**

```
pip install torch torchvision Pillow
```

### **Usage**

1. **Image**: Place your image file (e.g., `image.png`) in the same folder as the notebook.

2. **Run**: Open `Image_Captioning.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment and run all cells.

The notebook will then process the image and print the dummy caption.

## **🧑‍💻 Extend It!**

This is a starting point. Feel free to integrate a real language model to generate meaningful captions!

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements, new features, or bug fixes, please feel free to:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add new feature').
5. Push to the branch (git push origin feature/your-feature-name).
6. Open a Pull Request.
